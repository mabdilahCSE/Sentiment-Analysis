        "Trying to quantify how social media affects the real world is not a new idea. The specific question we are trying to ask, relating social media impressions and box office success for movies, has been explored by other parties in the past. A thesis paper from the University of Miami school of communication found positive correlation coefficients between engagements in Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter and box office numbers[^dejesus]. In the paper, engagements were calculated by accounting for the followers of posts. The author took movies from Rotten Tomatoes, used Box Office Mojo for revenue data, and used Rival IQ (a social media platform analytics service). These positive correlation coefficients suggest that there \"exists a moderate or strong positive correlation between engagement rates and box office for limited release films\". \n",
        "\n",
        "Another similar study by Neuralink and Facebook hoping to uncover the impact social media has on a movie’s success, particularly box office sales, found that Facebook ads contributed a significant portion to a movie’s marketing (20%) despite only accounting for a small percentage of its expenditure (4%).[^meta] In other words, the budget spent on Facebook ads ended up having a larger impact than its cost would entail. In the study they acknowledge how social media has become a competitive platform for media consumption, likening it to how television was revolutionary in marketing back in its heyday. Similarly, our group acknowledges how social media has become an influential and impactful communication platform, replacing traditional methods of self-expression such as word of mouth with the publishing of public posts. As such we hope to uncover if the brief mention of movie titles in people’s posts, has the potential to drive up sales for movies.\n",
